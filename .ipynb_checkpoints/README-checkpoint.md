# CPSC-5310: Machine Learning
**Seattle University - Winter 2026**

## Overview
This repository contains my coursework and projects for CPSC 5310 - Machine Learning at Seattle University during the Winter 2026 quarter. The course covers fundamental and advanced machine learning concepts, from data preprocessing and exploratory analysis to building, training, and evaluating various ML models.

## Skills Deveoped

- **Data Science Fundamentals**: Data manipulation with Pandas/NumPy, EDA, visualization, preprocessing (missing values, scaling, encoding)
- **ML Algorithms**: Linear/Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and text classification models
- **Model Evaluation**: Cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, MSE, RMSE, R²)
- **End-to-End Workflows**: Complete ML pipelines from data collection to model deployment
- **Tools & Technologies**: Python, Jupyter, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
