    "    \n",
    "You will be using a medical insurance dataset.\n",
    "Below are some informations to help **frame the problem**:\n",
    "\n",
    "For a health insurance company to make money, it needs to collect more in yearly premiums than it spends on medical care to its beneﬁciaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, insurers invest a great deal of time and money in developing models that accurately forecast medical expenses for the insured population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Medical expenses are diﬃcult to estimate because the costliest conditions are rare and seemingly random.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, some conditions are more prevalent for certain segments of the population. For instance, lung cancer is more likely among smokers than non-smokers, and heart disease may be more likely among the obese.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this analysis is to use patient data to estimate the average medical care expenses for such population segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "These estimates can be used to create actuarial tables that set the price of yearly premiums higher or lower, depending on the expected treatment costs.\n"

    "## Collecting data\n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis, we will use a simulated dataset containing hypothetical medical expenses for patients in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data was created using demographic statistics from the US Census Bureau, and approximately reﬂect real-world conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data includes **1,338 examples** of beneﬁciaries currently enrolled in the insurance plan, with features indicating characteristics of the patient as well as the total medical expenses charged to the plan for the calendar year. There are 6 features:\n",
    "\n",
    "    • age: An integer indicating the age of the primary beneﬁciary (excluding those above 64 years, since they are generally covered by the government).\n",
    "\n",
    "    • sex: The policy holder’s gender, either male or female.\n",
    "\n",
    "    • bmi: The body mass index (BMI), which provides a sense of how over- or under-weight a person is relative to their height. BMI is equal to weight (in kilograms) divided by height (in meters) squared. An ideal BMI is within the range of 18.5 to 24.9.\n",
    "\n",
    "    • children: An integer indicating the number of children/dependents covered by the insurance plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "    • smoker: A yes or no categorical variable that indicates whether the insured regularly smokes tobacco.\n",
    "\n",
    "    • region: The beneﬁciary’s place of residence in the US,divided into four geographic regions: northeast, southeast, southwest, or northwest.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to give some thought to how these variables may be related to billed medical expenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, we might expect that older people and smokers are at higher risk of large medical expenses. Unlike many other machine learning methods, in regression analysis, the relationships among the features are typically speciﬁed by the user rather than being detected automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s explore some of these potential relationships.\n"
